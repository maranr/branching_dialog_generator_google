# Project Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and improvements for the Branching Dialogue Creator. It serves as a guide for future development.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] **Mini-map**: A small, draggable map for easier navigation on large, complex canvases.
- [ ] **Multi-Node Selection**: Allow users to select, move, and delete multiple nodes at once.
- [ ] **Auto-Layout**: A button to automatically arrange nodes in a clean, logical tree structure.
- [ ] **Customizable Themes**: Allow users to change the colors of nodes and the canvas background.
- [ ] **Rich Text Editing**: Support for bold, italics, and lists within the dialogue and coaching text areas.
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement shortcuts for common actions like adding nodes (`Ctrl+N`), deleting selected nodes (`Delete`), and previewing (`Ctrl+P`).
- [ ] **Snap to Grid**: Add an option to have nodes snap to a background grid for easier alignment.

### Advanced Scenario Logic
- [ ] **Variable System**: Allow creators to define and track variables (e.g., `customerSatisfaction`, `itemsScanned`).
- [ ] **Conditional Branching**: Enable options that only appear or lead to different nodes based on the state of a variable.
- [ ] **Timed Responses**: Add an option in the player for timed challenges where the user must respond within a certain window.
- [ ] **Multi-Speaker Support**: Expand beyond two speakers to allow for group conversation scenarios.
- [ ] **Randomization**: Allow a node to randomly pick one of several paths to follow.

### AI Integration Improvements
- [ ] **Full Scenario Generation**: Generate an entire multi-node scenario from a single high-level prompt (e.g., "Create a training scenario for a barista handling a complicated coffee order").
- [ ] **Scenario Analysis & Feedback**: Use AI to analyze a completed scenario and provide feedback on its clarity, emotional tone, and potential dead ends.
- [ ] **AI-Generated Coaching Tips**: Automatically generate coaching feedback for specific nodes based on best practices for the situation described.
- [ ] **Tone & Style Modification**: Allow users to select a node and ask the AI to rewrite it in a different tone (e.g., "Make this more empathetic," "Make this more assertive").

### Export & Integration
- [ ] **SCORM Export**: Export scenarios in a SCORM-compliant format for easy integration with corporate Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- [ ] **PDF/Text Script Export**: Generate a clean, readable script of the entire dialogue tree for review or offline use.
- [ ] **Shareable Link**: A feature to host a playable version of the scenario online and generate a unique, shareable link.
- [ ] **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with services like Google Drive or Dropbox to save and load scenario files directly from the cloud.

### Collaboration
- [ ] **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to edit the same scenario simultaneously, similar to Google Docs.
- [ ] **Commenting**: Enable users to leave comments on specific nodes for team feedback and review.
- [ ] **Version History**: Track changes to a scenario over time and allow users to revert to previous versions.
